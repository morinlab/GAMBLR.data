\title{Assign CN to SSM.}
\usage{
assign_cn_to_ssm(
  this_sample_id,
  genes,
  this_seq_type = "genome",
  projection = "grch37",
  coding_only = FALSE,
  assume_diploid = FALSE,
  include_silent = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{this_sample_id}{Sample ID of the sample you want to annotate.}

\item{genes}{A vector of characters with gene symbols (Hugo).}

\item{this_seq_type}{Specified seq type for returned data. Default is genome.}

\item{projection}{Specified genome projection that returned data is in reference to. Default is grch37.}

\item{coding_only}{Optional. set to TRUE to restrict to only coding variants (ssm).}

\item{assume_diploid}{Optional, this parameter annotates every mutation as copy neutral. Default is FALSE.}

\item{include_silent}{Logical parameter indicating whether to include silent mutations into coding mutations. Default is FALSE. This parameter only makes sense if \code{coding_only} is set to TRUE.}

\item{...}{Any additional parameters.}
}
\value{
A list containing a data frame (MAF-like format) with three extra columns:
log.ratio is the log ratio from the seg file (NA when no overlap was found).
LOH and CN (the rounded absolute copy number estimate of the region based on log.ratio, NA when no overlap was found).
}
\description{
Annotate mutations with their copy number information.
}
\details{
This function takes a sample ID with the \code{this_sample_id} parameter and annotates mutations with copy number information.
A variety of parameters are at hand for a customized workflow. For example, the user can specify if only coding mutations are of interest.
To do so, set \code{coding_only = TRUE}. This function internally calls \code{get_ssm_by_samples} and \code{get_sample_cn_segments}.
This function can also take a vector with genes of interest (\code{genes}) that the returned data frame will be restricted to.

cn_list = assign_cn_to_ssm(this_sample_id = "DOHH-2",
                           coding_only = TRUE)
