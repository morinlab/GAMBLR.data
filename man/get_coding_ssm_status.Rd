\usage{
get_coding_ssm_status(
  gene_symbols,
  these_samples_metadata,
  maf_data,
  include_hotspots = TRUE,
  keep_multihit_hotspot = FALSE,
  review_hotspots = TRUE,
  genes_of_interest = c("FOXO1", "MYD88", "CREBBP"),

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_symbols}{A vector of gene symbols for which the mutation status
will be tabulated. If not provided, lymphoma genes will be returned
by default.}

\item{these_samples_metadata}{The metadata for samples of interest to be
included in the returned matrix. Only the column "sample_id" is
required. If not provided, the example metadata is used as default.}

\item{maf_data}{data frame in maf format. Must be in the grch37 projection.}

\item{include_hotspots}{Logical parameter indicating whether hotspots object
should also be tabulated. Default is TRUE.}

\item{keep_multihit_hotspot}{Logical parameter indicating whether to keep the
gene annotation as mutated when the gene has both hot spot and
non-hotspot mutation. Default is FALSE. If set to TRUE, will report the
number of non-hotspot mutations instead of tabulating for just mutation
presence.}

\item{review_hotspots}{Logical parameter indicating whether hotspots object
should be reviewed to include functionally relevant mutations or rare
lymphoma-related genes. Default is TRUE.}

\item{genes_of_interest}{A vector of genes for hotspot review. Currently only
FOXO1, MYD88, and CREBBP are supported.}

\item{genome_build}{Reference genome build for the coordinates in the MAF
file. The default is hg19 genome build.}

\item{include_silent}{Logical parameter indicating whether to include silent
mutations into coding mutations. Default is FALSE.}

\item{include_silent_genes}{Optionally, provide a list of genes for which the
Silent variants to be considered. If provided, the Silent variants for
these genes will be included regardless of the include_silent argument.}

\item{...}{Any other parameter. These parameters will be ignored.}
}
\value{
A data frame with tabulated mutation status.
}
\description{
Tabulate mutation status (SSM) for a set of genes.
}
\details{
This function takes a data frame (in MAF-like format) and converts
it to a binary one-hot encoded matrix of mutation status for either a set of
user-specified genes (via gene_symbols) or, if no genes are provided, default
to all lymphoma genes. The default behaviour is to assign each gene/sample_id
combination as mutated only if there is a protein coding mutation for that
sample in the MAF but this can be configured to use synonymous variants in
some (via include_silent_genes) or all (via include_silent) genes.
This function also has other filtering and convenience parameters giving
the user full control of the return. For more information, refer to the
parameter descriptions and examples.
Currently only the grch37 genome build is supported for hotspot annotation
and review for this version of the function.
