# Installation

In most instances, you would not need to install GAMBLR.data as a stand-alone package. GAMBLR.data is included as dependency and will be auto-installed for you with installation of [GAMBLR.open](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.open) or [GAMBLR](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR) from the [GAMBLR-verse](./concepts/GAMBLR_family.html). However, if you do need to install this package separately, we recommend installing the package directly from GitHub (requires `devtools` dependency).

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github(
    "morinlab/GAMBLR.data",
    repos = BiocManager::repositories()
) # <1>
```

After installation, you can list the bundled objects to confirm successful setup:
```r
# Confirm successful setup
library(GAMBLR.data) # load package
ls("package:GAMBLR.data") # view all supplied objects
```
