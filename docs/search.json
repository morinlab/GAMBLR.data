    "text": "GAMBLR.data is the first and most basic member of the GAMBLR family of packages. It is mostly serving a purpose of storing the bundled data helpful for genomic analysis of B-cell neoplasms in GAMBLR, and also contains small basic functions serving as API to retreive this data.\nSome of the bundled data is versioned and it keeps being updated. This insludes, but is not limited to, regions targeted by aSHM (new regions are being added as they are identified), curated list of lymphoma genes, somatic mutations hotsposts etc. Conveniently for the user, unless they request the specific version of the data, the most recent and up-to-date version is used by default.\nThe GAMBLR family includes:\n\nGAMBLR.data - this package\nGAMBLR.helpers - a set of low-level functions for data operation\nGAMBLR.utils - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data\nGAMBLR.viz - set of functions used mostly for visualizations\nGAMBLR.results - used for access of the full data in GAMBL project. Only available for the members of the Morin Lab and requires access to GSC, but can also be run locally once properly configured and synced.\n\nThis diagram illustrates a simplified way of dependency relationship for different packages in the GAMBLR.family:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"GAMBLR.data\") --&gt; B(\"GAMBLR.helpers\")\n  B --&gt; C(\"GAMBLR.utils\")\n  C --&gt; D(\"GAMBLR.viz\")\n  D --&gt; E{\"Morin Lab member?\"}\n  E -- YES --&gt; F(\"GAMBLR.results\")\n  E -- NO --&gt; A\n\n\n\n\n\nAll dependencies should be installed for you just like for any other R package.

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are several key concepts underlying the logic behind the GAMBLR.data package. The main terms are:\n\nprojection: This is a coordinate system defining the relationship with genome build and chromosome prefixing. The main projections supported throughout GAMBLR.data are grch37 and hg38. The grch37 projection is always not prefixed and is in relation to the coordinate system of the hg19 genome build. In contrast, the hg38 is always chr-prefixed and is in relation to the coordinate system of the hg38 genome build. As GAMBL itself and the data bundled and available through this package represents a large collection of samples sequenced both locally and externally, there is always a difficulty associated with proper handling of prefixes, different custom contigs and their lengths in the fasta reference, coordinates, and other distinctions complicating the direct comparison and comprehensive data analysis. This is handled internally and is always availabe in one or the other projection regardless of initial genome build to which the sample was aligned to.\nmetadata: This is a data frame with a set of minimal required columns such as patient_id, Tumor_Sample_Barcode, sample_id, seq_type, sex, cohort, and pathology. The columns like sex and cohort can contain NA calues but must be present in the metadata. The main purpose of this data frame is to provide a structure for the metadata that is always expected to be available and provides linkage between unique sample identifiers and associated basic metadata values. The columns Tumor_Sample_Barcode and sample_id are expected to contain duplicate values, but are required to be present for direct operation on the outputs of different upstream tools.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
