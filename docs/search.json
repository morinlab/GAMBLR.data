    "text": "There are several key concepts underlying the logic behind the GAMBLR.data package. The main terms are:\n\nprojection: This is a coordinate system defining the relationship with genome build and chromosome prefixing. The main projections supported throughout GAMBLR.data are grch37 and hg38. The grch37 projection contains the same coordinate system as genome build hg19, but never has the “chr” prefix on chromosome names. In contrast, the hg38 projection is always chr-prefixed and is in the same coordinate system as the hg38 genome build. As GAMBL itself and the data bundled and available through this package represents a large collection of samples sequenced both locally and externally, there is always a difficulty associated with proper handling of prefixes, different custom contigs and their lengths in the fasta reference, coordinates, and other distinctions complicating the direct comparison between data and comprehensive data analysis. These difficulties are handled internallyby making data always available in both projections, regardless of initial genome build to which the sample was aligned.\nmetadata: This is a data frame with a set of minimal required columns: patient_id, Tumor_Sample_Barcode, sample_id, seq_type, sex, cohort, and pathology. The columns like sex and cohort can contain NA values but must be present in the metadata. The main purpose of this data frame is to provide a structure for the metadata that is always expected to be available and provides linkage between unique sample identifiers and associated basic metadata values. The columns Tumor_Sample_Barcode and sample_id are expected to share the same values, but are required to be present for direct operation on the outputs of different upstream tools.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "GAMBLR.data is the first and most basic member of the GAMBLR family of packages. It serves the purpose of storing the bundled data helpful for genomic analysis of B-cell neoplasms in R.\nSome of the bundled data is versioned as it is continuously being updated. This includes, but is not limited to, regions targeted by aSHM (new regions are being added as they are identified), the curated list of lymphoma genes, somatic mutation hotspots, etc. Conveniently for the user, unless they request the specific version of the data, the most recent and up-to-date version is used by default.\nThe GAMBLR family includes:\n\nGAMBLR.data - this package.\nGAMBLR.helpers - a set of low-level functions for data operation.\nGAMBLR.utils - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data.\nGAMBLR.viz - set of functions used mostly for visualizations.\nGAMBLR.predict - a collection of machine learning algorithms and functions to pre-format inputs for these models. Contains classifiers of Burkitt and Follicular lymphomas originally published, as well as reproduced of DLBCL classification by the groupings of Chapuy et al, Lacy et al, and Runge et al.\nGAMBLR.open - used as a wrapper to load all of the packages listed above and also contains a light-weight functionality of GAMBLR.\nGAMBLR - used to access the full data in GAMBL project. Only available for members of the Morin Lab and memebers of the GAMBLR consortium. It requires access to GSC.\n\nThis diagram illustrates in a simplified way the dependency relationship of different packages in the GAMBLR.family:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"GAMBLR.data\") --&gt; B(\"GAMBLR.helpers\")\n  B --&gt; C(\"GAMBLR.utils\")\n  B --&gt; D(\"GAMBLR.predict\")\n  D --&gt; E(\"GAMBLR.open\")\n  C --&gt; F(\"GAMBLR.viz\")\n  F --&gt; E\n  F --&gt; H{\"GAMBL\\nconsortium\\nmember?\"}\n  H -- YES --&gt; G\n  C --&gt; G(\"GAMBLR.results\")\n  G --&gt; I(\"GAMBLR\")\n  H -- NO --&gt; E\n  style E fill:#6aa84f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4,font-size:20px\n  style I fill:#6fa8dc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4,font-size:20px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll dependencies should be installed automatically for you, just like with any other R package.
