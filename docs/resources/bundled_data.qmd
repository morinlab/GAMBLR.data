title: "Data bunded with GAMBLR.data"
---

The GAMBLR.data comes with many different bundled data objects that can be
systematically organized in the following categories:


## Somatic variants

* `sample_data` A list of data frames containing the metadata, simple somatic,
copy number, and structural variants collected together from the supplemental
tables of large sequencing studies of B-cell lymphomas.

## Curated gene lists

* `gene_blacklist` A tibble with gene symbols (Hugo) that falls within
blacklisted regions of the genome. The genes in this data object represent
common sequencing artefacts and are discarded during the data analysis.
* `lymphoma_genes`  A data frame with manually curated set of genes commonly
mutated in lymphomas with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating lymphoma
type(s) where the particular mutations are present. This object by default always
represents the most recent version of the curated list.
* `lymphoma_genes_bl_v0.1` A data frame with manually curated set of genes commonly
mutated in BL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating whether the
particular mutations are present. This is the versioned data and can be referred
directly by it's version number.
* `lymphoma_genes_bl_v_latest` A data frame with manually curated set of genes
commonly mutated in BL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating
whether the particular mutations are present. This object by default always
represents the most recent version of the curated list.
* `lymphoma_genes_comprehensive` A data frame with the curated list of genes
reported as significantly mutated in the large lymphoma studies. Both Ensembl ID
and Hugo Symbol are serving as gene identifiers. This data contains annotation
for the studies by Chapuy, Reddy, Wright (LymphGen), Lacy, as well as annotation
of being curated, reported as SMG in other_studies, or being aSHM target.
* `lymphoma_genes_dlbcl_v0.1` A data frame with manually curated set of genes
commonly mutated in DLBCL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating
whether the particular mutations are present. This is the versioned data and
can be referred directly by it's version number.
* `lymphoma_genes_dlbcl_v_latest` A data frame with manually curated set of genes
commonly mutated in DLBCL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating
whether the particular mutations are present. This object by default always
represents the most recent version of the curated list.
* `lymphoma_genes_lymphoma_genes_v0.0` Legacy version of the curated list of
genes significantly mutated in lymphomas. Bundled here for backwards compatibility
and can be referred directly by it's version number.
* `lymphoma_genes_mcl_v0.1`  A data frame with manually curated set of genes
commonly mutated in MCL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating
whether the particular mutations are present. This is the versioned data and
can be referred directly by it's version number.
* `lymphoma_genes_mcl_v_latest` A data frame with manually curated set of genes
commonly mutated in MCL with associated TRUE/FALSE columns annotating
whether the particular mutations are present. This object by default always
represents the most recent version of the curated list.
