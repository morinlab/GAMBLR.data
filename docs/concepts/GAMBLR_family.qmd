title: "GAMBLR family of packages"
---

GAMBLR.data is the first and most basic member of the GAMBLR family of packages.
It is mostly serving a purpose of storing the bundled data helpful for genomic
analysis of B-cell neoplasms in GAMBLR, and also contains small basic functions
serving as API to retreive this data.

Some of the bundled data is versioned and it keeps being updated. This insludes,
but is not limited to, regions targeted by aSHM (new regions are being added as
they are identified), curated list of lymphoma genes, somatic mutations hotsposts
etc. Conveniently for the user, unless they request the specific version of the
data, the most recent and up-to-date version is used by default.

The GAMBLR family includes:

* GAMBLR.data - this package
* GAMBLR.helpers - a set of low-level functions for data operation
* GAMBLR.utils - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data
* GAMBLR.viz - set of functions used mostly for visualizations
* GAMBLR.results - used for access of the full data in GAMBL project. Only
    available for the members of the Morin Lab and requires access to GSC, but
    can also be run locally once properly configured and synced.

This diagram illustrates a simplified way of dependency relationship for
different packages in the GAMBLR.family:

  A("GAMBLR.data") --> B("GAMBLR.helpers")
  B --> C("GAMBLR.utils")
  C --> D("GAMBLR.viz")
  D --> E{"Morin Lab member?"}
  E -- YES --> F("GAMBLR.results")
  E -- NO --> A
```

All dependencies should be installed for you just like for any other R package.
If not, please report the issue in the appropriate GitHub repo.
