There are several key concepts underlying the logic behind the GAMBLR.data
package. The main terms are:

* **projection:** This is a coordinate system defining the relationship with
genome build and chromosome prefixing. The main projections supported throughout
GAMBLR.data are `grch37` and `hg38`. The `grch37` projection is always not
prefixed and is in relation to the coordinate system of the hg19 genome build.
In contrast, the `hg38` is always chr-prefixed and is in relation to the
coordinate system of the hg38 genome build. As GAMBL itself and the data bundled
and available through this package represents a large collection of samples
sequenced both locally and externally, there is always a difficulty associated
with proper handling of prefixes, different custom contigs and their lengths in
the fasta reference, coordinates, and other distinctions complicating the
direct comparison and comprehensive data analysis. This is handled internally
and is always availabe in one or the other projection regardless of initial
genome build to which the sample was aligned to.

* **metadata:** This is a data frame with a set of minimal required columns such
as `patient_id`, `Tumor_Sample_Barcode`, `sample_id`, `seq_type`, `sex`, `cohort`,
and `pathology`. The columns like sex and cohort can contain NA calues but must
be present in the metadata. The main purpose of this data frame is to provide
a structure for the metadata that is always expected to be available and
provides linkage between unique sample identifiers and associated basic metadata
values. The columns `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` and `sample_id` are expected to
contain duplicate values, but are required to be present for direct operation on
the outputs of different upstream tools.
