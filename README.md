# GABMLR.data - an R package with community resources generated based on GAMBL results.

This package provides the standalone functionality with different sets of resources and basic functions generated by the [Morin Lab](https://morinlab.github.io/) based on GAMBL results. This is a recommended package from the set of GAMBLR packages for users outside of Morinla Lab and without GSC access.

It contains:

* published somatic variants from BL, DLBCL, and FL (studies by [Thomas et al](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/141/8/904/486739/Genetic-subgroups-inform-on-pathobiology-in-adult), [Dreval et al](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/6/561/495422/Genetic-subdivisions-of-follicular-lymphoma), [Schmitz et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1801445?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), [Chapuy et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0016-8), [Reddy et al](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31121-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417311212%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).) and variant calls from some DLBCL cell lines
* QC metrics from major WGS and WEX studies of B-cell lymphomas (as reported in [Dreval et al.](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/140/24/2549/486782/Minimal-information-for-reporting-a-genomics))
* Curated lists of lymphoma genes
* Curated list of regions affected by aSHM in B-cell lymphomas
* Coordinates of chromosome arms in both genome projections
* Gene coordinates in both genome projection
* Coordinates of oncogenes and SV partners in both genome projections
* Hotspot regions for selected genes in both projections
* Other resources

## Installation

GAMBLR.data is an open-source package. It can be easily installed directly from GitHub:

```
devtools::install_github("morinlab/GAMBLR.data", repos = BiocManager::repositories())
```


## Contributing

If you have access to gphost, the easiest way to obtain and contribute to GAMBLR is to do this via cloning the repository

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:morinlab/GAMBLR.git
```

In your R editor of choice, set your working directory to the place you just cloned the repo.

```
